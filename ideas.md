# IDEAS
to make a reliable system there are a few improvements that can be made for the systems that is gonna use ours, to have a better experience with it
- the first would be to make a queueing system
    - features:
        - encode+queue methods
            - option for either binascii or codecs as it has been an issue before
            - CSP
            - spacelink?
                - would imply firmware changes
            - fec?
- a gui
    - ability to view the current queue
        - a little bit like the interface in wireshark and the MCC
    - request beacons (testing feature)
